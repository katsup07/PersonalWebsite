        <h1>Future Dreams</h1>
        <p>Over the past 15 years, I have enjoyed teaching students and learning to be a teacher, but I am ready for a change and to take on new challenges. I enjoy designing and creating things, and mathematical/computational problem solving, so it would be good fit for me to work as a programmer. I hope I can learn more about the thought processes and various methodologies for building, updating, and maintaining programs, along with all the nitty gritty work that comes with that. There is a lot to learn, but it's the type of growth and development I am looking for.</p>
